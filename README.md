# MANDALA-COASTER

## A virtual reality fly-through, generated at each play with abstract shapes.
## The purpose of this project is to practice C# and my development process. Please read the [APPROACH](./APPROACH.md) file for documentation.

## GAMEPLAY
The player has a degree of influence on the generation: if they focus on the center that the particles emit from, there will be no variation in pattern. As their gaze moves away from the center, they introduce more randomness into the pattern. If they look too far away, the pattern deconstructs into chaos.

The patterns currently last for a set time, but I will add player choice to this.
